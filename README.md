# Calculator
 
This Godot program acts as a simple calculator. You have all 10 numbers available to you, as well as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Numbers can be positive or negative, and they can have decimals as well. There's a backspace and an ALL CLEAR button. Putting too many numbers in can make the screen slide off-screen, which is an issue that isn't covered in the tutorial.
